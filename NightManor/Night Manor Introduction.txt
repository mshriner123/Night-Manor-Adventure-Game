game introduction
You have woken from a deep but restless slumber, which was full of nightmares, 
only to find yourself living one. It is dark, damp, and difficult to see, and 
you can hear thunder cracking nearby. Just as your eyes begin to adjust, you hear a voice 
from the darkness say, Welcome to Night Manor! May you depart as abruptly as you arrived.
My name is Jacob Night III, and this is my home. The manor that you 
find yourself in is full of many dangers, and your adventures will 
surely be perilous, perhaps even fatal. I would welcome you more graciously, 
but my home was taken from me decades ago, and I fear for your safety. I 
will leave you soon because the longer I talk, the less time you have, and 
you must escape from this manor. Quickly! Before I leave, you must know that 
there are friendly ghosts and evil ghouls who wander the premises of Night Manor. 
They look similar, but do not mistake them. My poor home has become a terrible place! 
I bid you farewell.
