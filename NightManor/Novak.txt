first appearance
SUDDENLY, a ghost wearing ethereal chains and rags for clothes rushes through the wall!
He stops inches from you and says that he wants to make a deal. Do you want to listen to his deal?
Reply with: ghost, yes or ghost, no.

deal
I have been trapped in this mansion for ages. If you find a way to release me from my eternal
bond with Night Manor, I will unlock this door and set you free from your cell. Also, you will need my 
help navigating the halls and rooms of this manor if you want to survive the night. I will include that in 
my offer. Do we have a deal?

no deal
The ghost wishes you luck and says that it won't be long before they come for you. He'll see you soon.
Shortly after, your door swings open. Three figures with chalk white skin and black cloaks step through the doorway, 
but before you can see any more details, a thick fog fills the room, and you have no way to defend yourself.
Now, you are eternally bonded to Night Manor. You will have to wander these halls as a ghost for
eternity.
